This current project is to build a basic HTML file that displays the skills that have been taught thus far in the Odin Project.
Created basic HTML pages that exercise unordered lists, ordered lists, anchors and hrefs, adding images, using headers, and making seperate paragraphs. On reflection, these skills themselves are quite easy. Need more experience with committing to github. Specifically, I added the index.html and it recorded my commits to that just fine, but I made many commits to the additional recipe pages that were not recorded on Github. I was unaware that I had to add them seperately to the repo, I thought they would automatically be included if linked to from the index page. All in all this was an enjoyable/easy exercise.
